    "staking q": "What is staking?",
    "staking para 1": "The action that token holders stake their tokens to validators to secure the network is called staking. Staked tokens are eligible to receive staking rewards. Newly minted tokens and transactions fees are given out as rewards to bonded staking token holders.",
    "staking para 2": "Stakers stake their staking power to validators, but that does not mean the validators possess or have custody of the tokens staked to them. In other words, validators cannot steal or take away stakers’ tokens. Your staked amount of tokens will not be decreased in most situations, however, if your validator is punished by slashing, your staked token is at risk of being slashed too (see below for “slashing”).",
    "difference q": "What is the difference between custodial and non-custodial?",
    "difference para 1": "For custodial, the private key is held by a third party whereas non-custodial, users are responsible for their assets and in full control.",
    "unstaking q": "What are unstaking and restaking?",
    "unstaking para 1": "The action of transferring your staked tokens from one validator to another, it is called restaking your tokens. Your rewards will keep calculating if you choose to restake. Your rewards will stop calculating once you choose unstaking. It is subject to a lockup period (normally 21-day) and during this lockup, you cannot do anything with your tokens that are undergoing unlocking.",
    "unstaking para 2": "Therefore, if your plan is to continue with staking, and you simply wish to switch to a different validator, use restake instead to continue accruing your staking rewards and airdrops.",
    "unstaking para 3": "After the first restaking, you need to wait for a certain period of time (corresponding with unstaking period) before making another restaking transaction. And do make sure you have sufficient funds in your available balance to pay for the transaction fee.",
    "risks q": "What are the risks of staking?",
    "risks para 1": "There may be some risks when your validator is having poor performance or making critical mistakes, your funds will be slashed accordingly.",
    "benefits q": "What are the benefits of staking?",
    "benefits desc": "There are two key benefits of staking:",
    "benefits bullet 1": "Earn your staking rewards, it allows you to earn rewards for securing the network with your contribution",
    "benefits bullet 2": "Boost network security, the more token holders that stake, the more secure the network becomes",
    "reward q": "What is staking reward and how often are the rewards distributed?",
    "reward para 1": "Newly minted tokens and transaction fees are given out as rewards to bonded staking token holders. The rewards rate varies depending on the total amount of staked tokens, and each network has their specific settings.",
    "reward para 2": "<0>You can calculate your staking rewards <1>here</1>. You can also view your real-time rewards on each Big Dipper explorer. Or if you are interested in the detailed calculation, please refer to the whitepapers or tokenomics papers of each network, which can be found on their websites.</0>",
    "reward para 3": "Staking rewards should be “claimed” before becoming available in your account. This is a type of transaction so you would need to pay for the transaction when claiming rewards. While staking new tokens, your rewards will automatically be claimed into your available balance. The rewards are also automatically withdrawn to your account if there is a network upgrade.",
    "receiving q": "Why am I not receiving staking rewards?",
    "receiving bullet 1": "Nominated validators are not in the active set",
    "receiving bullet 2": "Nominated a validator with 100% commission holders. The rewards rate varies depending on the total amount of staked tokens, and each network has their specific settings.",
    "drop q": "Why did my staking rewards drop?",
    "drop desc": "There are a few possible reasons:",
    "drop bullet 1": "Inflation changed due to Parameter change Proposal",
    "drop bullet 2": "Bonding ratio changed (usually the higher bonding ratio, the lower the inflation rate)",
    "drop bullet 3": "Your validator(s) increased their commission rate",
    "claim q": "How often should I claim my staking rewards?",
    "claim para 1": "There is no model answer because this depends on too many factors, including how many tokens staked, transaction fees in that particular network, etc.",
